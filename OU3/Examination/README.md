# Examination

The assignment is fail/pass. Decisions with regard to the grade are based on the submitted source code and -most importantly- a code demonstration. During the code demonstration, the group presents their work to the examiner and aims to prove to the examiner that the implementation works as specified.

## Code

The source code of the node is submitted via labres one day before the scheduled code demonstration. Note that the deadline is strict and no exceptions will be made.

The code is not expected to be perfect. For example, minor memory leaks are tolerated. However, we do expect that the node implementation follows the requirements in the specification and
that the code is well documented.

As always, there is a zero-tolerance policy with regard to cheating and plagiarism. Credit your sources appropriately. 

## Demonstration
It is the task of the group to convince the examiner that their implementation satisfies the specification. Each group has 15 minutes.

It is important that you present either on the lab computers or on the institutions servers.

### Functionality
The group showcases the functionality of their node by preparing a series of interesting test scenarios. An example of such a scenario could be to start a node, to insert 300 data entries and to start 255 additional nodes -showing that no data is lost in the process. Note that the group has to identify the important test scenarios.

When it comes to nodes and data, the more the merrier, but at least 5 nodes and 50 data entries should be present in one or more of the scenarios.

### Problem Solving, Design Choices
In the second part, the group discusses the choices made with regard to the implementation of the node. What were the difficulties? How were important problems resolved? Prepare a list of features of highlights (or possibly lowlights) of your implementation.

### General
Reflections on the assignment, your group's work distribution, as well as a quick explanation of the code are also expected.


**The examiner might ask additional questions and have extra test scenario requests if deemed necessary.**
